Interactive Pollme app

This app provides you with basic functionality to host a poll that updates as people vote for it

It can be viewed here for a demo: terencelegrange.com/pollme

You need a PHP+mySQL+Apache stack. I recommend XAMPP.

Unpack the files, and install the database. Then open the site_config.php and edit away. There are two sections - dev and prod.
